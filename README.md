# UnityMobile Base

A base app for me when starting mobile Unity projects.

Currently with Firebase installed. Planned to have admob integration and any in app purchases too.

Uses Git LFS. So please install Git LFS first and then clone this project instead of directly downloading the zip file.

```
git clone https://github.com/purrmiaw/unitymobilebase
```
